# Spec-dock Issue Execution

- Use this skill for issue execution work.
- Typical fit: implement the active issue through approved behavior-slice execution and update `report.md`.
- Start from `spec-dock/active/context-pack.md`, then follow the issue workflow.
- `spec-dock/docs/workflow_issue.md` is the source of truth for issue execution and completion.
- `spec-dock/docs/workflow_spec_authoring.md` is the source of truth for issue requirement / design / plan phase promotion before execution.
- Normal lifecycle path: start with `./spec-dock/scripts/spec-dock issue start <target>` and finish with `./spec-dock/scripts/spec-dock issue finish`.
`issue finish` is lifecycle closure only: it closes or confirms the linked GitHub issue and clears active state, but it does not guarantee commit, push, PR, merge, validate, test, or review completion; delivery completion still requires separate evidence in tests, reviews, reports, and PR/merge workflow.
- Treat direct `./spec-dock/scripts/spec-dock active set ...` as a manual / recovery command, not the primary issue execution path.
- For shared phase authoring method, use:
  - `spec-dock/docs/workflow_spec_authoring.md`
  - `spec-dock/docs/phase_requirement.md`
  - `spec-dock/docs/phase_design.md`
  - `spec-dock/docs/phase_plan.md`
  - `spec-dock/docs/phase_plan_issue.md`
- Keep templates as scaffolds. Use the docs above for authoring guidance, including Issue dependency analysis, `Module Dependency Diagram`, Linux `tree` style file-change planning, and step ordering.
- Spec authoring mode: shape `requirement.md`, `design.md`, and `plan.md` for the project. Add, remove, merge, reorder, or rewrite template sections when it improves correctness, human understanding, or agent executability. Remove irrelevant placeholders.
- In spec authoring mode, do not move from requirement to design, design to plan, or plan to implementation until a fresh `spec-reviewer` returns `review_status: pass`; fix findings and re-run a fresh reviewer until pass.
- Record each `Spec Authoring Gate` in `spec-dock/active/issue/report.md`, including investigation, user questions/answers, reviewer verdict, fixes, and promotion decision.
- In spec authoring mode, use the optional diagram catalog in `spec-dock/docs/phase_design.md` as the authoritative source for diagram choices. Add catalog-listed or project-specific sections only when they clarify the issue.
- Execution mode: follow the approved issue docs. If the docs are missing required detail or contradict the implementation path, update/review the docs before implementation continues.
- Record report-scoped delivery completion evidence in `spec-dock/active/issue/report.md` before running `./spec-dock/scripts/spec-dock issue finish`, because `issue finish` clears active state after lifecycle closure. Final commit hash and post-commit clean evidence are recorded after the final commit as external delivery evidence.
- Treat `Spec-Locked Closure Index` as the issue-wide coverage ledger, not as a single test-case catalog. Execute and close work through each step's `step closure contract`.
- Treat each implementation step as a commit unit: `1 implementation step = 1 code-reviewer scope = 1 commit`.
- Before each implementation step starts, run an `Implementation Delegation Gate` decision and record it in `spec-dock/active/issue/report.md`.
- Delegation is conditionally mandatory when a step crosses multiple layers, modules, or packages; affects runtime / CLI / infra / templates / shipped scaffold / shared docs; needs existing-pattern or impact analysis; touches integration tests, migration, backward compatibility, filesystem, GitHub, or active state; or is large enough to split into an independent worker scope.
- Use `delegated` when a sub-agent is used, and record role, scope, request, returned result, and integration outcome. Use `approved-local-execution` only for small single-file changes, mechanical wording changes, clear localized changes, or immediate blocking / tightly coupled work that the main orchestrator should handle; record the no delegation rationale.
- If sub-agents are unavailable, use degraded mode and record the environment reason, alternate verification, and added review evidence. Degraded mode never waives `code-reviewer`, `qa-reviewer`, or `spec-reviewer` gates.
- Role selection matrix: `repo-analyst` maps code paths, impact, dependencies, and existing patterns before implementation; `dev-coder` handles bounded implementation steps with a clear write scope; `doc-writer` updates docs / templates / workflow / skill text; `qa-reviewer` owns final test adequacy and integration-test need; `code-reviewer` owns per-step diffs and the issue-wide integrated diff; `spec-reviewer` owns requirement / design / plan / report / implementation / docs alignment.
- Before implementation starts, stop if any required closure id in `plan.md` is not referenced from a behavior slice `closure ids` / `test ids` list, or if a required closure row has no step-local close condition, verification command, or evidence path.
- Do not change a required closure row, `locked expectation`, `required`, or meaning-bearing `spec link` during implementation without first updating the plan/design and getting re-review.
- Do not report complete unless every required closure id is closed in `spec-dock/active/issue/report.md` through `Step Contract Closure`, `Test Contract Closure`, and `Closure Coverage`.
- Record additions, removals, changed rows, intentionally unimplemented rows, and re-review decisions in `Closure Delta`.
- For every implementation step with changes, run the `code-reviewer` sub-agent on that step diff and iterate fixes / re-review until `review_status: pass`.
- Implementation delegation does not replace review gates. Even if `dev-coder` or another worker implemented the step, the resulting step diff still requires per-step `code-reviewer` pass.
- After the step `code-reviewer` pass, commit the step scope before moving to the next implementation step. Prefer `$git-commit-conventional-ja` or an equivalent Japanese multi-line Conventional Commit flow grounded in the staged diff.
- Do not mix multiple implementation steps in one commit. If the step is too large for one reviewable commit, split the plan step before implementation continues.
- Use `approved-no-op` only when the step has no diff. Record the no-op reason, checked contracts/files, diff-clean command, and review or read-only confirmation evidence in `spec-dock/active/issue/report.md`.
- Do not skip the docs impact resolution step or the final quality gate.
- In `S90 docs impact resolution`, inspect docs / templates / README / workflow / skill / migration notes impact. If docs updates are required, use `doc-writer` for the update and `spec-reviewer` for docs/spec alignment review.
- In `S99 final quality gate`, run `qa-reviewer`, issue-wide `code-reviewer`, and `spec-reviewer`. Iterate fixes and re-run the failing reviewer until all three pass.
- `qa-reviewer` owns test adequacy and whether an issue-wide integration test must be added before pass.
- The final `code-reviewer` owns the integrated issue diff, structure, responsibility boundaries, regression risk, and maintainability. It does not replace per-step code review.
- `spec-reviewer` owns requirement fulfillment and consistency across requirement, design, plan, report, implementation, tests, and docs.
- After all final reviewers pass, update the final report ledger with each step closure, final review results, final commit scope, and the post-commit external evidence destination. Then create the final commit and confirm no unintended staged or unstaged changes remain.
- Delivery completion must be confirmed before `issue finish` while the active issue is still set and confirmable, and `spec-dock/active/issue/requirement.md`, `design.md`, `plan.md`, and `report.md` contain issue-specific content rather than template, placeholder, or effectively blank content.
- `spec-dock/active/issue/report.md` must record command evidence for required `sync`, `validate`, implementation delegation decisions, per-step code review, step commit / approved-no-op, final QA review, final issue-wide code review, final spec review, and final report ledger / final commit scope before the final commit, including whether each required step succeeded, passed, reached approval, reached `delegated` / `approved-local-execution`, or reached `committed` / `approved-no-op`.
- Do not run `issue finish` until every required step has been executed, every required `sync` / `validate` step has succeeded or passed, every required review step has reached approval or pass, every implementation step has delegation evidence as `delegated`, `approved-local-execution`, or degraded mode, every implementation step is `committed` or valid `approved-no-op`, the final report ledger and final commit scope are recorded in `spec-dock/active/issue/report.md`, the final commit is complete, no unintended staged / unstaged changes remain, and the final commit hash plus post-commit clean evidence are recorded in external delivery evidence such as the final response, PR, or issue comment.
- After `issue finish`, do not require the active issue to remain set. Treat `issue finish` as lifecycle closure / GitHub close / active clear only.
- If any required step is skipped, or executed without a successful, pass, approved, `committed`, or valid `approved-no-op` outcome, classify the issue as `blocked` or `incomplete`, record the reason and next action in `spec-dock/active/issue/report.md`, and do not report the issue as complete.
- Treat the issue as `blocked` only when an external dependency, missing permission, unavailable service, or other environment condition prevents the next required action.
- When blocked, record the reason and next action in `spec-dock/active/issue/report.md`. Include blocker type and impact when applicable.
- Keep environment blockers separate from product gaps; missing implementation, missing docs updates, or missing evidence are incomplete unless an environment blocker prevents progress.
- When incomplete, record the reason and next action in `spec-dock/active/issue/report.md`.
- Do not report the issue as complete while it is incomplete or blocked.
- Primary workflow: `spec-dock/docs/workflow_issue.md`.
- `spec-dock/docs/reference_deps.md`
- `spec-dock/docs/reference_sync.md`
- `spec-dock/docs/reference_github.md`
- `spec-dock/docs/reference_naming.md`
- `spec-dock/docs/workflow_spec_authoring.md`

## Runtime command reminders

- Use runtime command path only: `./spec-dock/scripts/spec-dock ...`
- Normal issue execution lifecycle:
  - `./spec-dock/scripts/spec-dock issue start <target>`
  - `./spec-dock/scripts/spec-dock issue finish`
- `issue start -f` / `--force` bypasses only the unfinished active issue guard for switching away from another unfinished issue branch. It does not bypass dependency readiness, target validation, or checkout safety.
- `issue start` from `main` / `master` / `develop` / `staging` or another non-issue branch is allowed; the unfinished guard is for another unfinished active issue branch only.
- Use direct `active set` only for manual / recovery work. It remains outside the unfinished issue guard.
- After `issue finish`, avoid running `sync` on the just-finished issue branch when you need active clear to remain clear. `sync` can restore active from branch-derived issue context; move to `main` or another non-issue branch before final sync, or skip post-finish sync.
- Dependency mutation is command-first:
  - `./spec-dock/scripts/spec-dock deps add --from <issue-id> --to <issue-id>`
  - `./spec-dock/scripts/spec-dock deps remove --from <issue-id> --to <issue-id>`
  - `./spec-dock/scripts/spec-dock deps check <target>`
- Keep report evidence aligned with workflow checks:
  - `./spec-dock/scripts/spec-dock validate`
  - `./spec-dock/scripts/spec-dock sync`
- Use `--no-github` only for explicit cache/local verification with no GitHub calls.
