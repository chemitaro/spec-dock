# Spec-Dock Issue Execution

Use `spec-dock/docs/workflow_issue.md` as the source of truth. This skill is only a concise reminder for issue execution.

- Keep the parent agent responsible for orchestration, context, acceptance evidence, and final closure. Delegates may implement bounded tasks, but they do not own the issue.
- Preserve parent invariants before, during, and after delegated work: active issue context, allowed paths, acceptance criteria, reviewer requirements, and stop conditions remain the parent agent's responsibility.
- Treat `plan.md` as the planned executable workflow contract / command queue. Execute each implementation step through its behavior goal, planned obligation, Red or justified alternative evidence, implementation scope, Green verification, refactor guardrail, closure requirements, report evidence destination, and amendment trigger.
- Treat `report.md` as the observed evidence ledger for actual Red / Green / Refactor results, verification output, discovered tests, closure delta, reviewer verdicts, and commit/no-op evidence.
- Route step field semantics, `具体テストケース一覧`, obligation coverage, alternative evidence paths, and amendment rules to `spec-dock/docs/authoring/issue-plan.md`; keep lifecycle and completion policy in `spec-dock/docs/workflow_issue.md`.
- Route runtime, tests, and scaffold behavior to `dev-coder`.
- Route shipped docs, templates, skills, and workflow text to `doc-writer`.
- Treat unavailable tooling, denied access, host conflicts, waiver requests, and similar blockers as stop/incomplete unless explicit workflow policy evidence says they count as success.
- When review fails, perform bounded delegated follow-up and rerun review. Parent direct fixes require a documented Parent Implementation Exception.

## Runtime Command Reminders

- Use the shipped runtime path: `./spec-dock/scripts/spec-dock ...`.
- Normal lifecycle is `issue start <target>` before execution and `issue finish` only after the workflow completion gates pass.
- `issue start -f` / `issue start --force` bypasses only the unfinished-active-issue guard; it does not bypass readiness, target validation, or checkout safety.
- After `issue finish`, avoid `sync` on the just-finished issue branch when active clear must remain clear.
- Mutate dependencies command-first with `deps add`, `deps remove`, and `deps check`: `./spec-dock/scripts/spec-dock deps add --from <issue-id> --to <issue-id>`, `./spec-dock/scripts/spec-dock deps remove --from <issue-id> --to <issue-id>`, and `./spec-dock/scripts/spec-dock deps check <target>`.
- Evidence commands include `validate` and `sync`: `./spec-dock/scripts/spec-dock validate` and `./spec-dock/scripts/spec-dock sync`.
- Use `--no-github` only for explicit cache/local verification without GitHub calls.

Do not copy the full workflow here; update `workflow_issue.md` when execution policy changes.
