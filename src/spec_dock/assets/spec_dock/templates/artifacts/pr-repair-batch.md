## Batch Purpose

Use this repo-persistent batch to triage and repair blocking PR observation
results. A blocking result is a `P0`/`P1` review finding, required GitHub Actions
CI failure, visible merge conflict, blocking observation limitation, or other
merge-prepared blocker.

This batch separates raw intake from severity decisions, groups related findings
by `root_cause_family`, creates repair units only for blocking families, records
non-blocking findings only when a blocking repair commit is already being made,
and preserves residual risk for the final merge-prepared decision.

`root_cause_family` is documentation and LLM judgment vocabulary for this
discussion artifact. It is not a required runtime JSON field, parser contract,
blocker fingerprint, or stalled-observation contract.

## Persistence Policy

This file is for blocking repair work.

Use this repo-persistent batch when:

- `P0`/`P1` review findings exist.
- Required GitHub Actions CI failures exist.
- Merge blockers exist.
- Blocking observation limitations require repair or human-gate tracking.
- Branch mutation is already required for blocking repair and non-blocking
  findings can be recorded in the same commit without causing an extra CI run.

Do not update this batch solely to record terminal `P2`/`P3` findings after the
latest pushed head has no blockers. Record terminal `P2`/`P3` findings in the
final merge-prepared report instead, unless the user explicitly requests
separate follow-up tracking outside the current PR branch.

## Raw Intake Inventory

Add one row per observed review finding, required CI failure, merge blocker, or
observation limitation from the same observation batch. Keep raw reviewer
priority separate from the final severity decision.

| item_id | source_type | source_id | reported_priority | path | line | raw_summary | evidence_type | current_head_sha | family_id | intake_status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RXXX | review / ci / merge / limitation |  | P0 / P1 / P2 / P3 / CI / unknown |  |  |  | failing-test / repro / code-path / contract / observation |  | FXXX | untriaged |

Do not keep example rows as active inventory.

## Concern Family Catalog

Group inventory items by shared root cause. Do not repair comments one-by-one.

| family_id | root_cause_family | family_title | protected_domain | invariant_or_contract | related_items | max_reported_priority | decided_priority | merge_blocking | disposition | repair_unit | family_status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FXXX | issue_readiness.placeholder_contract |  | yes / no |  | RXXX | P0 / P1 / P2 / P3 / CI | P0 / P1 / P2 / P3 / required-ci / platform | yes / no / platform-only | fix-now / no-action / follow-up / needs-human / covered-by | UXXX / N/A | open |

## Classification Values

- `reported_priority`: `P0` / `P1` / `P2` / `P3` / `CI` / `unknown`
- `decided_priority`: `P0` / `P1` / `P2` / `P3` / `required-ci` / `platform` / `unknown`
- `merge_blocking`: `yes` / `no` / `platform-only` / `unknown`
- `validity`: `valid` / `partially-valid` / `false-positive` / `duplicate` / `unknown`
- `failure_class`: `check_failure:<actions_job_or_workflow_name>` / `review_feedback:<stable_topic>` / `merge_conflict` / `base_branch_conflict` / `permission_or_auth` / `external_or_flaky` / `platform_conversation_resolution` / `timeout` / `unknown`
- `need_to_fix`: `yes` / `no` / `follow-up` / `human-decision`
- `disposition`: `fix-now` / `follow-up` / `no-action` / `covered-by` / `needs-human`
- `status`: `untriaged` / `triaged` / `unit-needed` / `unit-created` / `implemented` / `reobserved-pass` / `blocked`

## Blocking Repair Queue

Create repair units only for `P0`/`P1` families, required CI failures, or
blocking merge issues. Do not create repair units for `P2`/`P3` findings unless
they are directly and unavoidably covered by the same `P0`/`P1` root-cause fix.

| unit_id | source_batch | family_id | covered_items | decided_priority | merge_blocking | disposition | repair_unit_disc | status | implementation_plan | quality_gate | commit_evidence | re_observation_result | residual_risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UXXX | <PR_REPAIR_BATCH_ID> | FXXX | RXXX | P1 | yes | fix-now | path / N/A | unit-needed |  |  |  |  |  |

## Non-Blocking Follow-up Register

Use this section only when a blocking repair commit is already being made and
`P2`/`P3` findings can be recorded without causing an additional record-only
push.

If the latest observation has only `P2`/`P3` findings and no blockers, do not
update this file. Put those findings in the terminal merge-prepared report
instead.

| followup_id | family_id | related_items | priority | rationale_for_no_action | residual_risk | suggested_followup_target |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NBXXX | FXXX | RXXX | P2 / P3 |  |  |  |

## Quality Gate Plan

Define family-level gates, not comment-level checks.

| gate_id | family_id | command_or_check | expected_result | covers_items | required_before_push |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GXXX | FXXX |  |  | RXXX | yes / no |

## Re-observation Plan

- Latest head before repair:
- Expected head after repair:
- Re-observation command:
- Trigger mode: post-once / resume
- Resume trigger comment id:
- Resume trigger created_at:
- New trigger approved: yes / no
- Re-observation required because:
- Re-observation skipped because:

## Loop Control

| iteration | head_sha | observation_status | family_id | action_taken | fix_commit | reappeared_after_fix | next_action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 |  |  | FXXX |  |  | yes / no |  |

Stop at a human gate when the same `root_cause_family` reappears after a repair
commit, unless a human explicitly approves a new strategy.

## Terminal Non-Blocking Report Boundary

When final re-observation contains only `P2`/`P3` findings:

- Do not update this batch solely to record them.
- Do not push a record-only commit.
- Do not trigger another review.
- Report those findings in the final response grouped by `root_cause_family`.
- State `branch mutation: no`.
- State `ci rerun avoided: yes`.
- State `review-clean: no`.
- State `merge-prepared: yes` if all blocking predicates are satisfied.

## Stop Conditions

Stop at a human gate when any condition applies:

- Any blocking inventory item remains `untriaged`.
- Any unresolved blocking `needs-human` item remains.
- A `P0`/`P1` `fix-now` repair unit is incomplete or repeatedly fails.
- The same `root_cause_family` reappears after a repair commit.
- Observation output is not for the latest head SHA.
- Timeout or observation limitation lacks resume metadata.
- Resume would cross the recorded trigger boundary.
- A new trigger would be required but has not been approved.
- Scope expansion, requirement expansion, breaking change, migration, secret,
  deployment setting, permission/auth, external/flaky, or ambiguous review
  intent is involved.
- Loop limits for the same root-cause family or total repair attempts are
  reached.
- GitHub branch protection requires conversation resolution for unresolved
  `P2`/`P3` threads; this is a platform human gate, not a code repair target.

## Merge-Prepared Gate

Report `merge-prepared: yes` only when all conditions are true:

- PR is open.
- Latest observation is complete and matches the latest head SHA.
- No observed required GitHub Actions CI failure remains.
- External/non-Actions check state has either been confirmed outside PR
  observation or is recorded as a human gate/residual risk.
- No unresolved `P0`/`P1` review feedback remains.
- Remaining `P2`/`P3` findings, if any, are grouped and reported as
  non-blocking terminal findings or recorded here because a blocking repair
  commit was already required.
- No visible merge conflict or equivalent semantic merge blocker remains.
- No blocking `untriaged` inventory item remains.
- No unresolved blocking `needs-human` item remains.
- No blocking item has an incomplete `fix-now` repair unit.
- Every repo-persistent `follow-up`, `no-action`, `covered-by`, `duplicate`, or
  `false-positive` item has rationale and residual risk where relevant.
- Observation limitation handling, resume metadata, trigger boundary, and new
  trigger approval status are recorded.
- Review-thread unresolved state is known, or unresolved-thread limitations are
  disclosed. If platform conversation resolution is required, stop at a human
  gate instead of claiming GitHub mergeability.
- `review-clean` is reported separately from `merge-prepared`.
- `github-mergeable` is not claimed unless platform requirements were confirmed.
